nanohtml2text
=============

0-dependency library to convert HTML to text; an alternative to
https://crates.io/crates/html2text that doesn't use a full browser-grade HTML
parser

Based on https://github.com/k3a/html2text -- basically a line-for-line rewreite

Primarily useful for displaying HTML emails. YMMV depending on the structure of
the HTML you're trying to convert.

This library has one function, html2text, which takes a an html &str and
returns a plain text String

on crates.io:
https://crates.io/crates/nanohtml2text

comes with a command line utility in main.rs to process from stdin if you want
to test/experiment with it
